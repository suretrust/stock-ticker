# Ticker App

This is a simple React stock ticker app with an integrated API (Polygon.io). This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Requirements

1. A user can type in a stock ticker (Ex: TSLA) and it displays a list of tickers matching with the input, in real time
    - The input can be typed partially and display relevant results(Ex: `TSLA` should show the Tesla stock)
    - The input can also be the name of the company (Ex: `Tesla` should show Tesla stock)
    - Optional: The price of each stock is listed
2. A user can select a ticker from the list
3. When selected, it displays the name of the ticker with the change since last day.

### Tech Stack

- React and Typescript
- Code is tested with Jest and react-testing-library.

### Design

 [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/npYI4Am7sdgzH2VZSVmZYl/Test-Task-Ticker-Impakt) â€” Due to the response from the search API and limit of 5 responses within a minute (for free plan), the design was slightly derailed.
